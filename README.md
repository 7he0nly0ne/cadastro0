You will need nodemailer and express to run this.
to install those dependencies, run this commands on your cmd:  'npm install nodemailer' and 'npm install express'

(make sure you are inside your project directory to run this)

you also need to upload the back-end services, just run this command on your cmd: 'node server.js'
make sure it's running inside the port 3000 which is the same of the front-end.
